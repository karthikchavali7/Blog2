    <h1 class="p">What is Full-Stack Development?</h1>
    <h4>Date: 29-05-2023</h4>
    <p class="h">Full-stack development is a term used to describe the process of developing both the front and back end of a website or application. A full-stack developer is a web developer who is proficient in all stages of software development, from the initial design and architecture of the project to the actual coding, testing, and deployment of the site.</p>

    <h1>Front-End Development</h1>
    <p class="h">The front end is part of a website or application that users directly interact with. It is responsible for a website's look, feel, and overall user experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="h">It involves many technologies and frameworks, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>REACT</li>
        <li>VUE</li>
        <li>ANGULAR</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="h">Front-end developers must be able to understand the design of a website or application, as well as the user experience. They must be able to write clean and efficient code, debug and troubleshoot problems, and optimize performance.</p>
    <h1>Back-End Development</h1>
    <p class="h">Back-end development is the process of creating the underlying architecture of a website or application. It is responsible for the functionality of the website or application and serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built. Back-end developers work with various programming languages, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>PYTHON</li>
        <li>RUBY</li>
        <li>JAVA</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="h">They use these languages to create the logic and structure of the website. They are also responsible for creating the APIs to communicate between the website and the database. Back-end development requires a strong understanding of databases, server configurations, and security protocols. Back-end developers must collaborate closely with front-end developers, designers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the application meets the user's needs.</p>
